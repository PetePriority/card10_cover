# card10_cover


          A simple cover for CARD10-badge:
          ================================
        * reduces surface complexity and covers space in between PCB's in order to keep dirt out
        * left/right/select buttons become much more usable as they get a bigger surface
        * on-off button is left as it is in order to avoid accidental pushing
        * diffuses light from the LED's which are mounted on top
        * the cover can be clipped onto the badge - there are no tools required to change the cover
        * the model has no overhangs, thus it is very easy to print
        
          Printing instructions:
          ======================
        * print upside down!
        * adjust value for "ledDiffusionThickness" so that the LED diffusor is only one layer high
        * adjust the value for "extra" in order to achieve a tight fit around the Harmonic board
        * I printed mine with .05mm layer height out of white PLA on an Ultimaker 2 with 0.4mm extruder
